<h1>Flowers</h1>
		<h4> The importance of flowers <br>
Flowers make an emotional impact on humans, providing consideration and comfort
Flowers serve as a natural decoration that adds colorful ambiance to a dull room. 
Flowers brighten any colorful occasion like weddings and birthdays and take the edge off sorrowful events such as funerals.
Flowers and ornamental plants increase levels of positive energy and help people feel secure and relaxed. 
Overall, adding flowers to your home or work environment reduces your perceived stress levels and makes you feel more relaxed, secure, and happy.
The biggest reason we give flowers as gifts is to connect with an emotion. Whether its love, joy, affection, appreciation, sympathy, romance or apologies; flower giving communicates the deepest feelings in the most elegant manner.
